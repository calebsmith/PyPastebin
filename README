About:
A pastebin implemented with Python, Django, and the Pygments library.

Use:
To run, untar the file, enter the directory and run the Django development 
server. Be sure to change the DATABASES dictionary 'NAME' key in 
settings.py to reflect an absolute path on your machine. To untar and run 
server from a terminal:

tar -xf paste.tar.gz
cd paste
./manage.py runserver

A port number can be specified if necessary, but the default is 8000. To 
specify a port, such as 8080, use the following:
./manage.py runserver 8080

To connect, type the following in a browser:
localhost:8000/

The default admin site can be reached through this URL:
localhost:8000/admin

When pasting, the user must paste some text in the "Code" text box, but all
other fields are optional and obtain default values upon submission. The text 
highlighting library, Pygments, uses a lexer that corresponds to the user's 
choice and attempts to guess the lexer in the case that the user has not 
provided the language.

In the detail view of a paste, the user may choose a different "style" for the 
text highlighting. The default style is called 'colorful'.
