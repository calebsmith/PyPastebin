About:
A pastebin implemented with Python, Django, and the Pygments library.

Use:
To run, untar the file, enter the directory and run the Django development 
server. Be sure to change the DATABASES dictionary 'NAME' key in 
settings.py to reflect an absolute path on your machine. To untar and run 
server from a terminal:

tar -xf paste.tar.gz
cd paste
./manage.py runserver

A port number can be specified if necessary, but the default is 8000. To 
specify a port, such as 8080, use the following:
./manage.py runserver 8080

To connect, type the following in a browser:
localhost:8000/

The default admin site can be reached through this URL:
localhost:8000/admin

When pasting, the user may paste some text in the "Code" text box or upload a 
source file, but all other fields are optional and obtain default values upon 
submission. The text highlighting library, Pygments, uses a lexer that 
corresponds to the user's language choice and attempts to guess the lexer in 
the case that the user has not provided the language. In the case of file 
uploads, the lexer is chosen based on the file extension.

In the detail view of a paste, the user may choose a different "style" for the 
text highlighting. The default style is called 'emacs'. The user may also 
choose to copy the paste, view it in plain text, or view the source of an 
entire HTML document that renders the submitted source with text highlighting.
The user may also click "Download" to download the file. If the user is viewing
their most recent paste, they have the option of deleting it.

The lists view provides a paginated and searchable list of all pastes.
